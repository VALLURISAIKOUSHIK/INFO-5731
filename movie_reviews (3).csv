0,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
1,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",youll wit brain fully switched watching oppenheimer could easily get away nonattentive viewer intelligent filmmaking show audience great respect fire dialogue packed information relentless pace jump different time oppenheimer life continuously hour runtime visual clue guide viewer time youll get grip quite quickly relentlessness help express urgency u attacked chase atomic bomb germany could absolute career best performance consistenly brilliant cillian murphy anchor film nailed oscar performance fact whole cast fantastic apart maybe sometimes overwrought emily blunt performance rdj also particularly brilliant return proper acting decade calling screenplay dense layered id say thick bible cinematography quite stark spare part imbued rich lucious colour moment especially scene florence pugh score beautiful time mostly anxious oppressive adding relentless pacing hour runtime fly found intense taxing highly rewarding watch film making finest really great watch
2,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
3,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

5,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
6,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

9,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
10,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
11,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

12,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",film look great brilliantly acted there virtually actual plot constantly jump back forward evey couple minute there unfeasibly loud music trying build tension jazzed documentary film painful three hour long hold attention entre way could easily forty minute hour le playtimethere good bit great whole film dull drag ive seen absolutely desire ever see im baffled everyone saying masterpiece suppose like long panoramic shot overbearing music great want decent story give miss
13,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

14,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
15,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
16,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
17,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
18,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

20,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

21,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
22,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
23,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best.

24,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.

25,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
26,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",youll wit brain fully switched watching oppenheimer could easily get away nonattentive viewer intelligent filmmaking show audience great respect fire dialogue packed information relentless pace jump different time oppenheimer life continuously hour runtime visual clue guide viewer time youll get grip quite quickly relentlessness help express urgency u attacked chase atomic bomb germany could absolute career best performance consistenly brilliant cillian murphy anchor film nailed oscar performance fact whole cast fantastic apart maybe sometimes overwrought emily blunt performance rdj also particularly brilliant return proper acting decade calling screenplay dense layered id say thick bible cinematography quite stark spare part imbued rich lucious colour moment especially scene florence pugh score beautiful time mostly anxious oppressive adding relentless pacing hour runtime fly found intense taxing highly rewarding watch film making finest really great watch
27,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
28,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

30,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
31,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

34,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
35,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
36,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

37,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",film look great brilliantly acted there virtually actual plot constantly jump back forward evey couple minute there unfeasibly loud music trying build tension jazzed documentary film painful three hour long hold attention entre way could easily forty minute hour le playtimethere good bit great whole film dull drag ive seen absolutely desire ever see im baffled everyone saying masterpiece suppose like long panoramic shot overbearing music great want decent story give miss
38,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

39,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
40,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
41,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
42,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
43,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

45,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

46,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
47,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
48,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
49,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

50,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
51,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",youll wit brain fully switched watching oppenheimer could easily get away nonattentive viewer intelligent filmmaking show audience great respect fire dialogue packed information relentless pace jump different time oppenheimer life continuously hour runtime visual clue guide viewer time youll get grip quite quickly relentlessness help express urgency u attacked chase atomic bomb germany could absolute career best performance consistenly brilliant cillian murphy anchor film nailed oscar performance fact whole cast fantastic apart maybe sometimes overwrought emily blunt performance rdj also particularly brilliant return proper acting decade calling screenplay dense layered id say thick bible cinematography quite stark spare part imbued rich lucious colour moment especially scene florence pugh score beautiful time mostly anxious oppressive adding relentless pacing hour runtime fly found intense taxing highly rewarding watch film making finest really great watch
52,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
53,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

55,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
56,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end
57,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer.

59,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
60,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
61,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

62,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

63,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

64,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
65,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
66,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
67,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
68,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

71,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
72,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
73,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
74,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

75,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
76,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

77,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
78,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

80,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie.

81,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt.

Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine .

84,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

86,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

87,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",film look great brilliantly acted there virtually actual plot constantly jump back forward evey couple minute there unfeasibly loud music trying build tension jazzed documentary film painful three hour long hold attention entre way could easily forty minute hour le playtimethere good bit great whole film dull drag ive seen absolutely desire ever see im baffled everyone saying masterpiece suppose like long panoramic shot overbearing music great want decent story give miss
88,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

89,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
90,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
91,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
92,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
93,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
96,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
97,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
98,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
99,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.

100,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
101,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

102,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
103,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

104,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

105,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
106,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

109,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

111,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

112,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

113,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

114,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
115,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
116,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
117,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world.

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

120,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
121,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
122,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
123,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
124,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

125,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
126,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

127,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

128,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

129,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

130,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
131,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

134,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

136,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

137,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

138,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

139,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
140,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
141,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them.

142,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
143,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

145,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
146,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
147,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
148,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
149,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

150,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

151,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

152,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

153,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

155,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
156,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

159,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

161,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

163,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

164,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

165,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
166,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
167,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
168,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

170,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
171,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
172,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
173,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
174,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

175,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

176,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

177,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

178,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

180,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
181,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

184,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

186,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

188,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

189,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
190,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
191,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
192,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
193,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

195,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
196,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
197,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
198,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
199,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

200,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

201,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

202,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion.

203,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

205,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
206,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

209,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

211,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

212,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",film look great brilliantly acted there virtually actual plot constantly jump back forward evey couple minute there unfeasibly loud music trying build tension jazzed documentary film painful three hour long hold attention entre way could easily forty minute hour le playtimethere good bit great whole film dull drag ive seen absolutely desire ever see im baffled everyone saying masterpiece suppose like long panoramic shot overbearing music great want decent story give miss
213,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

214,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
215,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
216,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
217,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
218,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

220,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
221,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
222,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
223,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

224,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.

225,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

226,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

227,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
228,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

230,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
231,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

234,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
235,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
236,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

237,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

238,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

239,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
240,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
241,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
242,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
243,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

245,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

246,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
247,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
248,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best.

249,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

250,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
251,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

252,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

253,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

255,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
256,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

259,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
260,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
261,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

262,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

263,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

264,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
265,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
266,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
267,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
268,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

271,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
272,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
273,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
274,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

275,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
276,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

277,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
278,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

280,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
281,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end
282,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer.

284,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

286,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

287,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

288,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

289,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
290,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
291,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
292,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
293,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

296,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
297,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
298,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
299,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

300,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
301,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

302,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
303,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

305,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie.

306,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

309,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

311,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

312,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

313,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

314,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
315,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
316,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
317,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
318,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
321,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
322,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
323,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
324,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

325,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
326,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

327,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
328,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

329,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

330,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
331,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

334,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

336,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

338,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

339,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
340,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
341,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed.

342,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world.

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
346,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
347,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
348,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
349,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

350,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

351,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

352,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

353,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

354,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

355,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
356,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

359,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

361,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

362,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

363,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

364,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
365,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
366,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them.

367,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
368,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
371,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
372,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
373,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
374,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

375,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

376,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

378,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

380,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
381,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

384,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

386,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

388,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

389,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

390,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
391,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
392,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
393,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

396,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
397,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
398,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

399,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

400,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

401,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

403,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

405,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
406,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

409,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

411,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

413,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

414,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
415,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
416,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
417,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
418,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

420,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
421,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
422,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
423,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

424,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

425,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

426,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

427,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion.

428,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

430,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
431,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

434,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

436,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

437,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",film look great brilliantly acted there virtually actual plot constantly jump back forward evey couple minute there unfeasibly loud music trying build tension jazzed documentary film painful three hour long hold attention entre way could easily forty minute hour le playtimethere good bit great whole film dull drag ive seen absolutely desire ever see im baffled everyone saying masterpiece suppose like long panoramic shot overbearing music great want decent story give miss
438,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

439,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
440,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
441,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
442,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
443,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

445,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
446,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
447,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
448,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

449,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.

450,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

451,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

452,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
453,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

455,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
456,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

459,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
460,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
461,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

462,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

463,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

464,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
465,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
466,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
467,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
468,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

470,"It's isn't a masterpiece.

471,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
472,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
473,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best.

474,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

475,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
476,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

477,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

478,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

480,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
481,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

484,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
485,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
486,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

487,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

488,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

489,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
490,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
491,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
492,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
493,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

496,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
497,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
498,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
499,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

500,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
501,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

502,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
503,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

505,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
506,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end
507,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer.

509,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

511,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

512,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

513,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

514,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
515,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
516,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
517,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
518,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

521,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
522,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
523,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
524,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

525,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
526,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

527,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
528,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

530,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie.

531,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

534,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

536,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

537,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

538,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

539,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
540,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
541,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
542,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
543,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
546,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
547,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
548,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
549,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

550,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
551,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

552,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
553,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

554,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

555,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
556,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

559,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

561,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

562,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

563,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

564,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
565,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
566,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
567,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world.

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
571,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
572,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
573,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
574,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

575,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

576,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

577,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

578,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

579,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

580,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
581,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

584,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

586,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

587,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

588,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

589,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
590,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
591,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them.

592,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
593,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
596,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
597,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
598,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
599,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

600,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

601,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

602,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

603,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

605,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
606,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

609,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

611,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

613,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

614,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

615,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
616,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
617,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
618,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
621,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
622,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
623,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

624,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

625,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

626,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

627,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

628,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

630,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
631,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

634,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

636,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

638,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

639,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
640,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
641,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
642,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
643,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

645,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
646,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
647,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
648,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

649,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

650,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

651,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

652,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old.

653,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

655,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
656,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

659,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

661,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

662,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",film look great brilliantly acted there virtually actual plot constantly jump back forward evey couple minute there unfeasibly loud music trying build tension jazzed documentary film painful three hour long hold attention entre way could easily forty minute hour le playtimethere good bit great whole film dull drag ive seen absolutely desire ever see im baffled everyone saying masterpiece suppose like long panoramic shot overbearing music great want decent story give miss
663,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

664,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
665,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
666,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
667,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
668,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

670,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
671,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
672,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
673,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

674,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.

675,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

676,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

677,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
678,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

680,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
681,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

684,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
685,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
686,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

687,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

688,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

689,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
690,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
691,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
692,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
693,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

695,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

696,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
697,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
698,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best.

699,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

700,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
701,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

702,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

703,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

705,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
706,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

709,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
710,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
711,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

712,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

713,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

714,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
715,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
716,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
717,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
718,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

721,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
722,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
723,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
724,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

725,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
726,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

727,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

728,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

730,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
731,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end
732,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer.

734,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

736,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

737,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

738,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

739,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
740,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
741,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
742,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
743,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

746,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
747,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
748,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
749,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

750,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
751,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

752,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
753,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

755,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie.

756,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

759,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

761,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

762,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

763,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

764,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
765,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
766,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
767,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
768,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
771,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
772,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
773,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
774,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

775,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
776,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

777,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
778,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

779,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

780,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
781,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

784,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

786,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

788,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

789,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
790,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
791,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
792,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world.

Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

796,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
797,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
798,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
799,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

800,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

801,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

802,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

803,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

804,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

805,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
806,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

809,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

811,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

812,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags.

813,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

814,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
815,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
816,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them.

817,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
818,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
821,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
822,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
823,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
824,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

825,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

826,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

827,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

828,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

830,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
831,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

834,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

836,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

838,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

839,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

840,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
841,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
842,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
843,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

846,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
847,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
848,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

849,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

850,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

851,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

852,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

853,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

855,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
856,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

859,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

861,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works.

863,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

864,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
865,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
866,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
867,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
868,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

870,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
871,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
872,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
873,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

874,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

875,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

876,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

877,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old.

878,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

880,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
881,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

884,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

886,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

887,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",film look great brilliantly acted there virtually actual plot constantly jump back forward evey couple minute there unfeasibly loud music trying build tension jazzed documentary film painful three hour long hold attention entre way could easily forty minute hour le playtimethere good bit great whole film dull drag ive seen absolutely desire ever see im baffled everyone saying masterpiece suppose like long panoramic shot overbearing music great want decent story give miss
888,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

889,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
890,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
891,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
892,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
893,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

895,"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

896,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
897,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
898,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

899,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.

900,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

901,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

902,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
903,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

905,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
906,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

909,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
910,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
911,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

912,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

913,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

914,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
915,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
916,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
917,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
918,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

920,"It's isn't a masterpiece.

921,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
922,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
923,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best.

924,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

925,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
926,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

927,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

928,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

930,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
931,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

934,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
935,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
936,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

937,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

938,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

939,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
940,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
941,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
942,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
943,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

946,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
947,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
948,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
949,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

950,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
951,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

952,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
953,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

955,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date really know even better touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe great big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb
956,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end
957,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer.

959,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world
960,"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad.",cillian murphy exceptional lead role oscar worthyill say he ably supported terrific ensemble cast great see james remar againthe film pose many moralistic question bomb repercussion oppenheimer film work best especially never seen moment dropped japan sound nightmarish look people face horrifichowever hr tedious talky frankly rather boringthe sound good visually didnt need made imaxits better tenet nice see mum dad
961,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season.

962,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

963,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time. I expect no one to agree with me here because truth today, has become scarce everywhere. This should have been a more straightforward, teachable movie!!

964,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
965,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
966,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
967,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
968,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

971,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
972,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
973,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
974,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

975,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great feel like loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one said dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way cant deny exceptionally well made one look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie currently feel though wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure
976,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

977,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",im big fan nolans work really looking forward understood would flipping timeline id need concentrate didnt find problem storytelling beautifully done acting universally excellent saw review saying emily blunt rather ott didnt find alli think biggest gripe film may mean im getting old found direction quite jarring jump cut galore keep thing moving along apace rather exhausting also found music sound loud point intrusion much like nolan film go interstellar love also loud musicall quality watch left longing day called cerebral biopics little tranquil
978,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy inception

980,"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie.

981,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",im still collecting thought experiencing film cillian murphy might well start clearing space mantle best actor oscarthis film masterclass weaving narrative different time period exploring profound depth man whose action altered world trajectory forever better worse nolan brings u complexity oppenheimer moral conflict stirring within himmurphys portrayal riveting long runtime became afterthought robert downey jr also offer great performance nolans push pull us sound design throughout cherry topsome viewer might need brief refresher wwii cold war history film lover happy willingly lose film hour end

984,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score youre honest there way mottled mess movie sane universeive seen nolans film memento brilliant calling card young director dark knight elevated superhero movie something amazing gritty crackling verisimilitude inception long slog exposition interstellar offering good moment also imploded weight writerdirectors egonolan like tackle big idea dream outer space delf quantum physic relegated line really oppenheimer offer kitty marrying explains quantum physic mostly space particle attraction one another hold handsfor first two hour oppenheimer lost blizzard short disparate scene constant musical score actor chewing endless dialog never allowed rest never really sure nolan offer two cryptic title card beginning fission fusion maybe way around separate time period public hearing robert downey jr main character desaturating black white makeup used age deage cillian murphy oppenheimer never really know quite fit sequentially contextually storythere public hearing closed hearing wolf pack hungry prosecutor semblance oppenheimer backstory love life gradual involvement government leading general matt damon reason hiring head los alamo mashed together scene never really second long cutting somewhere else something else often interpolated macro shot thing fizzing roiling exploding assume thats supposed sort visual metaphor work oppenheimer theorizing contemplating thats demonstration actually work oppenheimer save one scene near beginning inadvertently shatters beaker class hear he terrible labyet without exaggeration hour movie weve told least ten time oppenheimer brilliant genius never shown nolans chief sin teller shower writer really directortake beautiful mind comparison movie director ron howard regularly visualizes work john nash show instance watching pigeon gather crumb mind eye map pattern window overlaying view outside young men playing sport us piece white pastel draw diagram film visual mediumconsider schindlers list spielberg movie really observe blocking actor placement camera service telling story visually actor may dominate frame maybe back turned character may move create entirely new frame blocking relationship camera help tell storyin nolans filmmaking camera go really arbitrary cut shot writing actor reaction blocking scene editing feel clunky shot moving actor start reaction coming back actor already motion nolan cutting script relying dialog tell entire story even play blockingtrue decides tell story father abomb chiefly two hearing public one closed one there going lot talking double talking telling even one scene casey affleck sits beside oppenheimer room somewhere dont even know affleck playing really short he talking oppenheimer nolan cut back forth another scene matt damon train oppenheimer damon telling u affleck wantscharacter revealed action character explaining everything sidethere great many cameo nolans film star studded rather appearance name actor helping clarify character portrayed distract one point woman near theater said oh look remi malek appeared focused actor previous role charactereverything movie especially first ninety minute bounced like stone skipping water scene short music never stop many character always changing time place im really sure whats happening famous face keep popping dont understand everything franticonce get halfway mark trinity project get infamous test movie sink little thats nolan finally slows thing let u exist somewhere film moment let u immersedafter part he back whisking u one quick scene next pace try hard breathless exciting end distracting frustrating still felt tune second half film could sense dilemma emotional conflict oppenheimer hiroshima nagasaki one best scene film oppenheimer giving speech toast success american empire room turn white rumble woman skin flaysand finally another scene emily blunt kitty oppenheimer giving one wolf pack prosecutor piece mind closed hearing really steal show blunt truly enjoyable part movie though little screen timetheres much else say feel like listened hyperactive child try tell story thought already knew became unnecessarily convoluted telling didnt really learn anything new physic abomb really get sense mccarthyism era oppenheimer real reason could grasp close end apparently reservation using hbombnolan try twist holding back brief conversation oppenheimer einstein pond several nolans film big twist one felt kind paltry twist go drove home underlying grief sadness whole abomb project meant world

986,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

987,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension.

It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is.

988,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

989,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",starschristopher nolans oppenheimer bloated overwrought ultimately unsatisfying film film three hour long feel even longer thanks nolans penchant unnecessary scene character supporting character flat onedimensional dont enough time developthe sound music also loud overused noisy illusory scene glaring disturbing film also visually confusing nolans trademark use shaky camera quick cutsthe bright spot film matt damon performance general leslie grove damon give nuanced complex performance he enough save filmoverall oppenheimer mess long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film nolan overrated director often tell simple story complicated overlong manner filmadditional thoughtsi also disappointed film portrayal atomic bomb film doesnt really explore moral implication bomb doesnt really show devastation causedi also found film ending unsatisfying film end oppenheimer breakdown clear he learned experienceoverall would recommend oppenheimer anyone long confusing ultimately unsatisfying film
990,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.",came theater watching oppenheimer great experience know many people criticize movie historical accuracy absence think christopher nolan made complicated man story compelling engaging simple understand actor phenomenal apart main lead robert downey probably done one finest work expression timing delivery everything par cinematography crafted beautifully adored enjoyed whole three hour ease delight first attempt christopher nolan biography think expect work genre since entertaining also spark interest know history read book earlier went watch little bit knowledge still enjoyed film wish could tell cillian murphy person stunning screen presence throughout hopefully movie win award like deserves
991,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",master craftsman christopher nolan probably best blockbuster director along ridley scott return good old fashioned nocgi drama tension come word spoken people react chase shootout death defying stunt explosion wait actually one explosion dont know made scene without cgi technical achievement sureall shot mm imax beautiful film lead cast seasoned actor terrific jobmy gripe tad long final act couldshould trimmed still best movie seen yeari strongly recommend watch imax screen taken month
992,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",core oppenheimer technical masterpiece haunting score ludwig gransson one film profound highlight score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film
993,"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles.",isnt masterpiece decent biopic interesting person good performance probably minute longmuch better nolans recent outing he disappeared backside trying overly clever fan feel smarter actually arethe movie well take subject like quantum physic become bogged trying stroke intellectual egoit surprise murphy downey jr arent front runner acting award month others like emily blunt good little screentime really get role
996,"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story could focus scientific challenge really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer political drama much drama isnt enough emotional connection character care oppenheimer lose security clearance strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing care youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code happen lead character year later lot easier invested even though know war v result political hearing
997,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",review oppenheimer rating ten plus cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan think greatest movie yet
998,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event good telling biopic first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing let focus story main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view could much missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia
999,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.",saddens many people mistaking bigger louder quality first loud soundtrack matter good might doesnt equate quality film overwhelming complementing filmfor past year kept hearing see imax format perfect magnificent visuals sound effect strangely pseudo documentary little benefit enhanced film formatwe percent straightforward standard presentation nothing special pretty much talk withno memorable background camera angle special framingthen big event something last five minute underwhelming couldnt relate nuclear atomic reaction need imax premium formatwhat opportunity see depiction pretty choppy overlapping dialogue doesnothing allow u follow event movie jump various date point view wonder need shoot color black whitewe certainly dealing lawrence arabia schindlers list manhattan movie allowed u relish outstanding cinema could give u pain glory complex life eventlets fair give something due used meant perfection glare sparkle remember shine gold
